# My Web Development Journey

## Overview
Welcome to my personal web development project! This project was created as part of my coursework in my Intro to Web Development Course at Kennesaw State University. I aimed to design a user-friendly and visually appealing multi-page website, showcasing not only my growing technical abilities but also my passion for learning and growth.

## What's Included
This website consists of three main pages, each carefully structured with HTML, styled with CSS, and brought to life with JavaScript.

1. **Home Page**: A welcoming introduction that sets the tone for the project.
2. **About Page**: A deeper dive into who I am, showcasing my academic background and journey.
3. **Contact Page**: A simple form that allows visitors to get in touch with me directly.

## Tools and Technologies
- **HTML5**: Used to build the foundation and layout of each page.
- **CSS3**: Applied for a responsive and visually appealing design that adapts to different devices.
- **JavaScript**: Added for interactive functionality, including form validation on the Contact page.
- **Node.js**: Used for server-side processing to handle form submissions on the Contact page.

## Project Functionality

### Home Page
The **Home Page** serves as a welcoming introduction. It includes navigation links to the other pages, a brief overview of my journey, and a clean, modern design using CSS to make it visually appealing.

### About Page
The **About Page** is where visitors can learn more about me. It includes:
- A biography section detailing my background, interests, and journey at Kennesaw State University.
- A profile picture styled to fit neatly within the page design, making it visually engaging.

### Contact Page
The **Contact Page** includes a simple, user-friendly form that allows visitors to send me a message. This page is powered by Node.js and Express to handle form submissions. 

#### How the Contact Form Works
1. **HTML Form**: The form collects user input (Name, Email, and Message).
2. **JavaScript Validation**: Ensures that the required fields are filled before submission.
3. **Node.js Backend**: 
   - The data from the form is sent to the server using a POST request.
   - The server, built with Express, receives the data and logs it.
   - A confirmation message is displayed to the user upon successful submission.
