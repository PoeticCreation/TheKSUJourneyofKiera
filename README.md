# My Web Development Journey

## Overview
Welcome to my personal web development project! This project was created as part of my coursework in my Intro To Web Development Course at Kennesaw State University. I aimed to design a user-friendly and visually appealing multi-page website. Showcasing not only my growing technical abilities but also my passion for growing and learning.

## What's Included
This website consists of three main pages. Each of them carefully structured with HTML, styled with CSS, and brought to life with JavaScript.

1. **Home Page**: A welcoming introduction that sets the tone for the project.
2. **About Page**: A deeper dive into who I am and where I share my academic background.
3. **Contact Page**: A simple form that allows visitors to get in touch with me.

## Tools and Technologies
- **HTML5**: Used to build the foundation and layout of each page.
- **CSS3**: Used to create a responsive and visually engaging design that will work across devices.
- **JavaScript**: Added for advanced functionality, including form validation on the contact page.
- **Node.js**
