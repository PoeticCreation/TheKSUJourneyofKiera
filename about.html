                    <p>Hi! I'm Kiera Williams, a current student at Kennesaw State University majoring in Cybersecurity and minoring\
                        in Computer Science. I first started my studies at KSU in January 2024, during the spring semester. Ever since I\
                        learned about cybersecurity a few years ago, I\'92ve had a passion for understanding how to protect\
                        information in the digital age. That's what led me to KSU, where I decided to enroll in this exciting program.</p>\
\
                    <p>In my first semester at KSU, I was honored to be on the Dean's List, which has motivated me to set even\
                        higher academic goals. I\'92m currently working hard in my second semester, aiming to make the President's List.\
                        The coursework has been challenging but rewarding, and I am learning valuable skills that will help me in my\
                        future career.</p>\
\
                    <p>My goal is to continue excelling academically while gaining hands-on experience in cybersecurity. I am eager\
                        to apply the knowledge I\'92ve gained through internships and projects in the field. In the future, I hope to become\
                        a cybersecurity expert, contributing to a safer digital world.</p>\
